* TI84 Plus Basic programs
TODO: any info on building + running?


[[https://github.com/miselin/tibasic][TIBasic]] is used for building to a format the calculator understands. After building, the =.8xp= files can be transferred to the calculator directly. I just use the file names (without the extension) as the program names.


** Program info
Here I try to mention any relevant information on the programs.

*** x2solve
Quadratic equation solver. =AX^2 + BX + C = 0= Handles linear equations as well with =A=0=.

*** dot
Warning: Uses A and B matrix slots, and therefore overrides them even if they are currently in use.

*** getcol
Get a column C from a matrix. Fill in expected column in Ans, and matrix in matrix slot A. Uses matrix slot I for storage.


Result is found in Ans.
